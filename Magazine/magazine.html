                    I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a<br>transiton and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12<br>weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course. I've<br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                       Before joining the bootcamp, I've<br>never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from professionals<br>who can help me learn programming<br>step by step. I was encouraged to<br>enroll by a former student of their's<br>who can only say wonderful things<br>about the program. The entire<br>curriculum and staff did not<br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>and I never had to wait long for<br>assistance. The agile team project, in<br>particular, was outstanding. it took<br>my learning to the next level in a way<br>that no tutorial could ever have. In<br>fact, I've often referred to it during<br>interviews as an example of my<br>development experience. It certainly<br>helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>developer after receiving multiple<br>offers. 100% recommend!

                        The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The<br>program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br>myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br>personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.
